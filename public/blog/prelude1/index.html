<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<p>Songs whose lyrics we’ve forgotten, melodies we hum without thinking. This prelude was born from that space.<br>
Its chord progression draws subtle inspiration from &ldquo;One Summer’s Day&rdquo; by Joe Hisaishi, the iconic theme from Spirited Away: bringing a warm, nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of childhood memories. <br>
Both hands move in unison, echoing each other in a continuous fluid motion, gently repeating a phrase that feels like “Lalala”—as if the piano itself is humming a tune it once knew.</p>

Translucent in character, this prelude unfolds like a memory returning from sleep. A 2-against-3 polyrhythm moves gently beneath the surface, this quiet mismatch creates a soft, shifting tension—like the sensation of just waking, when a dream still lingers at the edge of memory. Flowing runs of notes drift through the music like glimmers of early sunlight—fleeting and delicate.

    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: B minor Tempo: Vivace Instrument: Piano Description This piece explores the evolving nature of inhibition through its harmonic and dynamic structure. It begins in the F♯ minor key, then shifts to D major—delaying the resolution to its true tonal center, the B minor key, until measure 18. This avoidance reflects how inhibition works: it buries the truth beneath layers of hesitation. Throughout the opening section, the melody primarily lies low, thick with muted tones, as if afraid to be heard. Once the music finally settles into B minor, a gradual transformation occurs: the dynamics begin to swell, and the melody ascends into a higher register. This shift marks a release of inhibition—the moment when what was once held back begins to emerge, more openly and assertively.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 6 in B minor (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",

    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: D major Tempo: Adagio Instrument: Piano Description Like waves rolling onto the shore, this prelude unfolds with a surface that seems repetitive and calm, yet beneath it lies constant variation and subtle unpredictability. The main melody, while appearing simple and recurring, reveals delicate shifts and surprises with each phrase. The piece opens unexpectedly with an E major chord, quickly settling into D major where the main melody is introduced, before drifting into the C minor key. In this modulation, the new melody provides a sense of emotional comfort to help feel secure despite the shift in the musical landscape. From there, it rises again—modulating to E major, momentarily revisiting the harmonic color of the introduction, as if the wave were pulling back before its final surge. Eventually, the music returns home to D major, completing its cyclical journey. Throughout, the left hand’s ascending and descending arpeggios gently imitate the natural motion of waves—rising, falling, retreating—creating a flowing undercurrent that drives the piece forward.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 5 in D major (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",

    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: E minor Tempo: Allegro Instrument: Piano Description \u0026ldquo;What Ifs\u0026rdquo; is a quiet meditation on uncertainty, where each phrase seems to question itself. The melody moves with a fragile hesitance, as if caught in a cycle of imagining how things might have been. The main melody is followed by a lower melodic phrase that acts as a response, like inner voices that is gently trying to comfort the internal conflict. A brief modulation to the key of D major occurs midway through the piece, offering a short-lived contrast in color and character. This tonal shift introduces a brighter harmonic context, which can be interpreted as a moment of clarity or reassurance. However, the modulation is not sustained; the music soon returns to E minor, reinforcing the original introspective state and leaving the emotional tension largely unresolved.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 4 in E minor (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",
