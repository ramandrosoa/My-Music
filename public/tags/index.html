    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: E major Tempo: Adantino Instrument: Piano Description This piece began as an improvisation on “Mary Had a Little Lamb” and features two voices representing the characters Mary and Jo. It opens in E major and moves through modulations to A minor, then to A major, where a solo passage emerges—Mary sings alone. Jo then enters, attempting to imitate Mary but with his own voice, modulating to D major and creating a playful dialogue. The piece gently returns to its home key of E major, bringing the musical conversation to an unified close.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 9 in E major (pdf)\nPreview",

It’s physically demanding—like struggling against a wall.

Translucent in character, this prelude unfolds like a memory returning from sleep. A 2-against-3 polyrhythm moves gently beneath the surface, this quiet mismatch creates a soft, shifting tension—like the sensation of just waking, when a dream still lingers at the edge of memory. Flowing runs of notes drift through the music like glimmers of early sunlight—fleeting and delicate. Rather than breaking the stillness, they gently brighten it, adding a quiet shimmer that deepens the sense of dreamlike calm.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 7 in A major (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",

    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: B minor Tempo: Vivace Instrument: Piano Description This piece explores the evolving nature of inhibition through its harmonic and dynamic structure. It begins in the F♯ minor key, then shifts to D major—delaying the resolution to its true tonal center, the B minor key, until measure 18. This avoidance reflects how inhibition works: it buries the truth beneath layers of hesitation. Throughout the opening section, the melody primarily lies low, thick with muted tones, as if afraid to be heard. Once the music finally settles into B minor, a gradual transformation occurs: the dynamics begin to swell, and the melody ascends into a higher register. This shift marks a release of inhibition—the moment when what was once held back begins to emerge, more openly and assertively.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 6 in B minor (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",

    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: D major Tempo: Adagio Instrument: Piano Description Like waves rolling onto the shore, this prelude unfolds with a surface that seems repetitive and calm, yet beneath it lies constant variation and subtle unpredictability. The main melody, while appearing simple and recurring, reveals delicate shifts and surprises with each phrase. The piece opens unexpectedly with an E major chord, quickly settling into D major where the main melody is introduced, before drifting into the C minor key. In this modulation, the new melody provides a sense of emotional comfort to help feel secure despite the shift in the musical landscape. From there, it rises again—modulating to E major, momentarily revisiting the harmonic color of the introduction, as if the wave were pulling back before its final surge. Eventually, the music returns home to D major, completing its cyclical journey. Throughout, the left hand’s ascending and descending arpeggios gently imitate the natural motion of waves—rising, falling, retreating—creating a flowing undercurrent that drives the piece forward.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 5 in D major (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",

    "content": " Composer: Minah Ramandrosoa Key: E minor Tempo: Allegro Instrument: Piano Description \u0026ldquo;What Ifs\u0026rdquo; is a quiet meditation on uncertainty, where each phrase seems to question itself. The melody moves with a fragile hesitance, as if caught in a cycle of imagining how things might have been. The main melody is followed by a lower melodic phrase that acts as a response, like inner voices that is gently trying to comfort the internal conflict. A brief modulation to the key of D major occurs midway through the piece, offering a short-lived contrast in color and character. This tonal shift introduces a brighter harmonic context, which can be interpreted as a moment of clarity or reassurance. However, the modulation is not sustained; the music soon returns to E minor, reinforcing the original introspective state and leaving the emotional tension largely unresolved.\nDownload Sheet Music Prelude No. 4 in E minor (pdf)\nPreview Instagram\n",

Rather than resolving in a traditional sense, the music folds back on itself. When the music returns to the G major key, it’s not a conclusion but a reset.
