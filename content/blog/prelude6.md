## Description

 This piece explores the evolving nature of inhibition through its harmonic and dynamic structure. <br>
 It begins in the F♯ minor key, then shifts to D major—delaying the resolution to its true tonal center, the B minor key, until measure 18. This avoidance reflects how inhibition works: it buries the truth beneath layers of hesitation. <br>
 Throughout the opening section, the melody primarily lies low, thick with muted tones, as if afraid to be heard. <br>
 Once the music finally settles into B minor, a gradual transformation occurs: the dynamics begin to swell, and the melody ascends into a higher register. <br>
 This shift marks a release of inhibition—the moment when what was once held back begins to emerge, more openly and assertively.
