## Description
Songs whose lyrics we’ve forgotten, melodies we hum without thinking. This prelude was born from that space. 
Its chord progression draws subtle inspiration from "One Summer’s Day" by Joe Hisaishi, the iconic theme from Spirited Away: bringing a warm, nostalgic atmosphere reminiscent of childhood memories.
Both hands move in unison, echoing each other in a continuous fluid motion, gently repeating a phrase that feels like “Lalala”—as if the piano itself is humming a tune it once knew.
