## Description

This prelude explores the looping potential of harmony, using the tritone as a key to unlock distant tonal relationships. <br> 
Rather than resolving in a traditional sense, the music folds back on itself. <br>
When the music returns to the G major key, itâ€™s not a conclusion but a reset. The journey could continue endlessly, looping forward and back like a thought that never quite settles.
