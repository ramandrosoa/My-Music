## Description

The melody from this piece came to me in a dream.
Soft and translucent in character, this prelude unfolds like a memory returning from sleep. A 2-against-3 polyrhythm moves gently beneath the surface, this quiet mismatch creates a soft, shifting tension—like the sensation of just waking, when a dream still lingers at the edge of memory. 
Soft, flowing runs of notes drift through the music like glimmers of early sunlight—fleeting and delicate. Rather than breaking the stillness, they gently brighten it, adding a quiet shimmer that deepens the sense of dreamlike calm.
