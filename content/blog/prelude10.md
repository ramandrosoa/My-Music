## Description

This piece explores two kinds of submersion: Drowning and Diving. It begins with a struggle — gasping right-hand figures imitate air bubbles, while the left hand sinks inexorably in low, descending bass. This is Drowning: fragmented, unstable, and breathless. <br>
<br>
Then comes Diving: a modulation to D major. The music becomes still, curious, and open, as if descending freely into the unknown. Quiet chords suggest the calm of underwater exploration. <br>
<br>
The piece ends on an A minor chord with an augmented fourth. The texture grows lighter, rising in shimmering gestures — a nod to Scriabin’s Fifth Sonata. This final figure suggests a distant glimmer flickering far above, barely visible through the deep.
