# Sheet Music Website

This is the repository for my personal sheet music website, where I share original compositions for free. The site is built using the [Quint](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-quint?tab=readme-ov-file) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and is deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Hugo** – Static site generator
- **Quint** – Clean and minimalist Hugo theme
- **Netlify** – Continuous deployment and hosting

## 📁 Structure
- `content/` – Markdown files for each page and score
- `static/` – Sheet music PDFs and other assets

## ✍️ About
The site features free downloads of my original sheet music. I compose as an amateur, and this platform serves as both a portfolio and a way to share music with others.
